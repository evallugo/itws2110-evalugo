Group Project Lab 1 README File

For this lab:

Helped contribute to the group home page by -

Creating and inserting logo on homepage

Added in background of space/stars

Added and created slogan

Switched/Tweaked colors in order for the page to look and match better with other content

Added box shadow to nav and glow to words

Helped fix homepage throughout the production process, for example if something seemed off or out of position on the home page I would try my best to get it back to where it should be

Did my entire personal page and tried to keep it as similar as I could to the main page. 

I had some trouble getting the fade in effect for my resume using css and java script so I researched for a while and spent most of my time on w3 schools and previous projects in order to finally get the effect. I made sure to comment as much as I could/needed in order to look back at the code and be able to use it again in the future.

Adding in the background image perfectly how I wanted it to look was also difficult as it would be stretched out too much, too dark, and even too light. But I was able to finally get it to show tiny stars that didn't interfere with the content but added to the "vibe" of the website as a whole

Made sure that the css and html were validated and hCard is also implemented (with an alteration in order to make it look good with the resume)
