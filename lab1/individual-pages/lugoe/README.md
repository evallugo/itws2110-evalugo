Progression:

My primary focus was creating a personal resume page and the team picture section. I began by setting up the basic HTML structure for both pages. Then, I tackled the styling, focusing on the dark theme, the starry background, and the overall layout. The most significant portion of my time was dedicated to creating the unique "paper" resume look and ensuring all the content was formatted correctly.


Challenges & Troubleshooting:

Formatting the Resume as a Sheet of Paper:
I had a very difficult time formatting the resume to look like a clean, professional sheet of paper. The positioning, sizing, and padding of the .paper div required a lot of trial and error. I struggled to get the dimensions right so it would look like an A4-sized page, regardless of screen size. The aspect-ratio property was crucial in maintaining the correct proportions. The internal padding and margins of the different resume sections also took a lot of finessing to make everything look neat and well-organized.

Positioning and Styling Content:
I also had some difficulty formatting the content within the resume. Ensuring that the dates were correctly aligned to the right using float: right and that the bullet points for the indented list items were positioned correctly using position: relative and left was a challenge. These seemingly small CSS details took a considerable amount of time and effort to get just right, but the final result of a clean, well-structured document was worth it.
