My Restuarant Menu Website:

--> I made my restuarant menu a display of my favorite puerto rican foods
--> I made the styling modeled after the puerto rican flag and Iwent for a simple and clean look
--> For JS, I used a hover highlight to make the item from the menu that you are looking at more obvious.
--> I used fetch() to load the data from the JSON file because it lets the webpage get information from an external file without reloading the page

I found this to be realatively straight forward and didn't run into any serious issues.
