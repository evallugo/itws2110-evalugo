Eva Lugo Lab 2


Contribution:

I've aided overall in the planning of this lab. I also created the group README.md file. Additionally, I went through and updated all of the citations and sources to ensure complete and correct referencing. On the front end side, I contributed to the styling ideas and usability. I also cleaned up the links that were just integrated and out of place on the website.


Difficulties:

I had conflicts with the collaborative coding environments. I was working on code that hadn't been updated which then resulted in conflcit with the rest of m groups changes. I also had some trouble using GitHub Desktop. I was getting errors when trying to commit to main. Overall, I worked through it and was able to complete the lab.
